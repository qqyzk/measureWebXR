# Gecko profile format

Profile data visualized in the Firefox Profiler is obtained from the [Gecko Profiler][nsIProfiler], a C++ component inside of Gecko. The [profiler.firefox.com] web app assumes that the Gecko Profiler add-on will activate the Gecko Profiler, gather the data, and then provide it to the client. This document talks about the Gecko profile format, which is distinct from the format that [profiler.firefox.com] uses. The plan is to migrate the Gecko profile format closer and closer [profiler.firefox.com]'s desired processed profile format.

## Running the Gecko Profiler independently from the add-on and client

The Gecko Profiler can be run on its own by executing the following code from a browser chrome context, like from the Browser Console in Firefox (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>J</kbd>):

```js
(() => {
  const settings = {
    entries: 1000000,
    interval: 0.4,
    features: ["js", "stackwalk", "threads", "leaf"],
    threads: ["GeckoMain", "Compositor"]
  };

  Services.profiler.StartProfiler(
    settings.entries,
    settings.interval,
    settings.features,
    settings.features.length,
    settings.threads,
    settings.threads.length
  );

  setTimeout(() => {
    Services.profiler.getProfileDataAsync().then(profile => {
      for (let i = 0; i < profile.threads.length; i++) {
        const thread = profile.threads[i];
      }
      console.log(profile);
      // Stopping the profiler will delete the data in the buffer.
      Services.profiler.StopProfiler();
    });
  }, 500);
})();
```

# Source data format

The source data format is de-duplicated to make it quicker to transfer in the JSON format. This specific format is documented in [ProfileBufferEntry.h]. In order to actually work with the data it must be re-mapped or have an interface wrapped around it to fetch all of the relevant information. The following is the general shape of the returned data in pseudo-code.

```js
{
  // Key/pair meta values about the profile.

The problem with this provided format for the use in [profiler.firefox.com] is that it creates a lot of little objects. Because of this GC pauses become a real issue. So rather than have a bunch of small objects that get passed around, the data is mapped into a new form. For instance looking at markers the data goes through the following mapping.

### Original data

```js
markers: {
  schema: {name: 0, time: 1, data: 2},
  data: [
    [1, 37070.186708, { ... }],
    [2, 37385.485834, { ... }],
    [5, 37471.444024, { ... }],
    ...
  ]
}
```

### Mapped data

```js
markers: {
  name: [1, 2, 5, ...],
  time: [37070.186708, 37385.485834, 37471.444024, ...],
  data: [{...}, {...}, {...}, ...],
}
```

While this format is a little more difficult to work with compared to mapping into the shape of `[{name, time, data}, {name, time, data}, ...]`, it has benefits in the speed of the [profiler.firefox.com] web app and the lack of GC pauses.

### Processed Profile Format

The threads of the processed profile use the above format and include the following keys:

Profile data:

 * samples
 * markers

Index-based table data:

 * resourceTable
 * frameTable
 * funcTable
 * stackTable
 * stringTable

Miscellaneous data:

 * name
 * libs
 * tid

Different frames can be created from the same function, and thus do not represent the unique set of functions. This function table is generated during [profiler.firefox.com]'s pre-processing step. Frames can provide additional information about the various ways the function was executed, while it's also useful to have a list of only the functions, so both types of information are retained.

```js
funcTable: {
  address: [ 65438929, 65632509, -1, ... ],
  isJS: [ false, false, true, ... ],
  name: [ 0, 1, 2, ... ], // Index into the string table, has the function name.
  resource: [ 0, 1, -1, ... ], // TODO, what does this represent?
  length: 6258,
}
```
